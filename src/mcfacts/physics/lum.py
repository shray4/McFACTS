    Estimate the shock luminosity from the interaction between a merger remnant 
    and gas within its Hill sphere.

    Based on McKernan et al. (2019) (arXiv:1907.03746v2), this function computes:
    - The Hill radius of the remnant system.
    - The local height of the disk.
    - The gas volume inside the Hill sphere.
    - The mass of gas inside the remnant's Hill sphere.
    - The energy and timescale over which energy is dissipated into the disk.

    The shock luminosity is given by:
        L_shock ≈ E / t,
