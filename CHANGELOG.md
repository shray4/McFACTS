### Individual PRs (summaries) in the order they were merged into main-dev

#### [315: Major stars update: NSC capture, dynamics](https://github.com/McFACTS/McFACTS/pull/315)
-   delta_energy_strong renamed to delta_energy_strong_mu with delta_energy_strong_sigma parameter added to reflect that for the star-star and star-BH interactions this is a Gaussian distribution

#### [318: Changed variable names, removed usage of unused variable](https://github.com/McFACTS/McFACTS/pull/318)
#### [319: Proposing sweep function and adding tests](https://github.com/McFACTS/McFACTS/pull/319)
- Added proposed sweep variant for the circular_singles_encounters_prograde function, along with testing infrastructure for it.
#### [320: dynamics: added flag_dynamics_sweep](https://github.com/McFACTS/McFACTS/pull/320)
- Changes the default behavior of model_choice_old.ini to use the new sweep implementation created by Nico, and provides a way to turn it on/off (flag_dynamics_sweep).
#### [321: Cube Optimizations](https://github.com/McFACTS/McFACTS/pull/321)
- By changing from using np.poly.root() to find the cube roots of various items, we can instead make use of a closed form analytical solution. This leads to an ~1.6x runtime speed improvement over the original function.
#### [322: bugfix](https://github.com/McFACTS/McFACTS/pull/322)
- Fixing issue with previous PR where the cardano kwarg for circular_singles_encounters_prograde_stars was not properly set in sim.py. Also renaming cardano to fast_cube for informativity.
#### [323: Paper gw231123](https://github.com/McFACTS/McFACTS/pull/323)
- Added new IMF options
- Implemented `precession` alternative for computing merger and remnant quantities
#### [325: Updated documentation and ReadInputs.py ](https://github.com/McFACTS/McFACTS/pull/325)
- Added a description of the precession option to ReadInputs.py and created earlier error handling for precession module.
#### [327: fixing circular_singles_encounters_prograde edge check](https://github.com/McFACTS/McFACTS/pull/327)
- Fix the edge case error which occurs when a particle is exactly on the edge of the disk radius, such that it is not kicked back in yet does not pass the assert test.
#### [331: Updating spin calculations and plots](https://github.com/McFACTS/McFACTS/pull/331)
- Updated spins to the correct T&M '08 calculations/reference frame.
- Created a spin_check.py file to reset the spins to a specific range in order to better match the NRsurrogate.
- Created new plots to show a histogram of the number of spins in the spin_v_kick figure.
#### [336: EM Models for LSST](https://github.com/McFACTS/McFACTS/pull/336)
- Added a script to calculate the EM model of a the thermal emission of a BBH merger in AGN disk with the velocity of forward shock. Also added data files for LSST filters that are being used here
#### [337: Some new print statements and minor tweak to disk mass/gained file writing](https://github.com/McFACTS/McFACTS/pull/337)
#### [330: Contributing Guidelines](https://github.com/McFACTS/McFACTS/pull/330)
- Updated the pull request documentation: https://mcfacts.readthedocs.io/en/main-dev/commitmsg.html
#### [338: Saving immortal star files, update parameter for star coalescence](https://github.com/McFACTS/McFACTS/pull/338)
- Created arrays `stars_all_id_nums`, `stars_masses_initial`, and `stars_orb_a_initial`
- Created new `AGNImmortalStar` object
- Added checks and output files for immortal stars
#### [348: adding documentation.rst](https://github.com/McFACTS/McFACTS/pull/348)
- Adding a rough page with instructions on installing sphinx/compiling documentation pages.
- https://mcfacts.readthedocs.io/en/main-dev/MM_documentation.html
#### [342: Eliminating unnecessary operations from si_from_r_g](https://github.com/McFACTS/McFACTS/pull/342)
-  Rewriting `si_from_r_g` to optionally accept a pre-computed value of `r_g` in meter units, allowing the function to skip the expensive initialization of this value in most cases.
#### [341: Created spin_check function to make the default T&M08 more accurate](https://github.com/McFACTS/McFACTS/pull/341)
- Spin check system for the default model has been updated
- Labels for the compare_plots.py file have been corrected
#### [340: Changes to lum.py](https://github.com/McFACTS/McFACTS/pull/340)
- Removed unused variables in jet_luminosity function of lum.py and made appropriate syntax change to called function in merge.py. Removed si to cgs conversion so si units carry through, without changing the result in the shock_luminosity and jet_luminosity functions.
#### [352: Retrograde Math Fix](https://github.com/McFACTS/McFACTS/pull/352)
- Correcting the order of operations issue in the tau_semi_lat method slows down retrograde evolution.
- Correcting the check for things flipping prograde to only look at the orbital inclination. It was previously setup to let anything with zero eccentricity flip.
- Setting the lower limit of retrograde eccentricities to the critical eccentricity (0.01). Having an eccentricity of exactly 0 causes some issues with the analytical model. Since retrogrades were incorrectly flipped, this was previously not an error we ran into.
#### [353: Update paper citations with ApJ links](https://github.com/McFACTS/McFACTS/pull/353)
- This pull request moves the citations from `README.md` to `docs/source/cite.rst` and adds the new hyperlinks to the fully published ApJ articles.
#### [354: Renamed exploded stars to disrupted](https://github.com/McFACTS/McFACTS/pull/354)
#### [351: Optimization: Accelerating `tau_*_dyn` functions with Rust + Pedantry](https://github.com/McFACTS/McFACTS/pull/351)
- We introduce the first set of Rust accelerants for McFACTS, as part of the [McFAST](https://pypi.org/project/mcfast/) helper module, now on PyPI.
- McFAST surfaces two functions, `tau_ecc_dyn_helper`, `tau_inc_dyn_helper`, which take over the vectorized computations performed by NumPy with optimized Rust functions.
#### [358: Updating star visualizations](https://github.com/McFACTS/McFACTS/pull/358)
- Updated scripts for star visualizations for more relevant plots and animations. These now match what is present in my dissertation and are formatted with the McFACTS plot styling.
#### [356: fixing tau_dyn test file](https://github.com/McFACTS/McFACTS/pull/356)
- Fixed malformed structure of test file that caused pytest to fail when running tau_dyn test.
#### [355: Nojulia](https://github.com/McFACTS/McFACTS/pull/355)
- Created explicit NumPy/Python version requirements for McFACTS
- removed SxS dependencies from pyproject.toml and enforced imports in ReadInputs for `flag_use_surrogate`
#### [359: docs: include instructions for validation steps and optional testing](https://github.com/McFACTS/McFACTS/pull/359)
- Updates the PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md file to add instructions for running and installing pytest
- Clarify a few items in the checklist
#### [361: Paper 4 housekeeping](https://github.com/McFACTS/McFACTS/pull/361)
-  Changed paper_em name for .ini file folder to paper_4, reverted phenom_turb_std_dev = 1.0 to 0.1 (default=0.1).
