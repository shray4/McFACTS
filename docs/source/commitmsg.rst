The ``type`` and ``scope`` must be lower case.

**<type> must be one of:**

* ``feat`` – a new feature is introduced with the changes
* ``fix`` – a bug fix has occurred
* ``chore`` – changes that do not relate to a fix or feature and don't modify src or test files (for example updating dependencies)
* ``refactor`` – refactored code that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
* ``docs`` – updates to documentation such as a the README or other markdown files
* ``style`` – changes that do not affect the meaning of the code, likely related to code formatting such as white-space, missing semi-colons, and so on.
* ``test`` – including new or correcting previous tests
* ``perf`` – performance improvements
* ``ci`` – continuous integration related
* ``build`` – changes that affect the build system or external dependencies
* ``revert`` – reverts a previous commit
* ``merge`` - use when manually merging two branches

**[scope] examples:**

* ``phys`` - physics
* ``io`` - input/output
* ``vis`` - visualization
* ``setup``
* ``ext`` - external module interfaces
* etc.

**<description> should be:**

#. present tense
#. gramatically structured to complete the sentence, "If applied, this commit will _____."


The ``[optional body]`` can be used to include additional details when necessary, and \
``[optional footer(s)]`` should be used when the change addresses a reported issue, ``Closes #123``).

   updated things again

This one does not follow the format, is not descriptive, and leaves me as a reviewer/bug hunter with a few questions:

1. Did you update the spherical cow approximation for calculating the coriolis force?
2. Was this a simple change to the sign of the integer flag that sets chirality?
3. What did you do last time since you said "again"?
